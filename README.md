- 👋 Hi, I’m @vburrows people call me "Levi" like the jeans. I have been using vburrows as an ID for going on 30 years. 
- 👀 I’m interested in Python used for OSINT
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web scraping and data sorting
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on hunting child predators on the internet
- 📫 How to reach me ........ that's a little tricky

I am a VBA expert with an extensive library of code for Excel and Access that I will show one day.


Things most geeks dont know about me is I am working on my 3rd career. I have retired from AT&T as a Systems Administrator and from the Army as a military Chief Intelligence Analyst, I did some work in special operations for about 5 years and taught military Intel operations for a couple of years as well. I really enjoy solving problems and creating function solutions that increase capacity. My goal is to pretty much automate the collection and sorting process so I or anyone else can be a one man (or woman) intelligence team. 

Let's see what happens
